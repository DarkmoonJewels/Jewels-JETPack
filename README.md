# Jewels-JetPack
This is a WIP mod for the EFT 12.12 Bad Santa edition.

Currently, the mod adds several new items, 2 new traders, a couple dozen quests, and many tweaks to the overall gameplay of EFT. It can be considered something of a "Lite" overhaul.

# Install
To install, simply copy the contents of the "server" folder into your JET server installation. Overwrite when asked. This mod overrides base server files so I suggest backing them up before installing in case you want to uninstall the mod in the future.

You need to install JET normally first. This mod only includes the server files it needs. Check out the EFT JET discord for more info.

**I suggest starting a new profile using the "JETPack" profile type**

# Differences From Vanilla

**New Level Progression**

One of the biggest differences is that the different maps are unlocked as you level up. No longer can you go into reserve at level 1. This does interrupt the flow of some questlines, but levelling has been overall improved so it doesn't take as long. You unlock each map at the corresponding level:

* Factory: Unlocked at start
* Customs: 5
* Woods: 10
* Shoreline: 15
* Interchange: 25
* Reserve: 35
* Lighthouse: 40
* Labs: 40

**Insurance**

Insurance can now be unlocked as early as level 10 and for a fee of 1,000,000 Roubles. No longer will Prapor and Therapist be the ones retrieving your lost valuables. Instead, one of the new traders - Spectre - is now your one and only source of insuring your items. He needs to be unlocked through a quest chain provided by the other new trader, Benefactor. To make this change worth it, insurance is now returned to you after only 1 hour and has a 100% chance to get everything back.

**Rebalanced Levelling**

Levelling of both the PMC and Skills have been slightly altered to provide a better single player experience.

**Skill Training**

Once unlocked, Spectre can train the player in various different skills for a nominal fee. Currently, as of 0.9.0 he only trains the PMC in Endurance and Strength. More skills will be added later.
