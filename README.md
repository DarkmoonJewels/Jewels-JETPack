# Jewels-JetPack
This is a WIP mod for the EFT 12.12 Bad Santa edition.

Currently, the mod adds several new items, 2 new traders, a couple dozen quests, and many tweaks to the overall gameplay of EFT.

# Install
To install, simply copy the contents of the "server" folder into your JET server installation. Overwrite when asked. This mod overrides base server files so I suggest backing them up before installing in case you want to uninstall the mod in the future.

You need to install JET normally first. This mod only includes the server files it needs. Check out the EFT JET discord for more info.

# Differences From Vanilla

One of the biggest differences is that the different maps are unlocked as you level up. No longer can you go into reserve at level 1. This does interrupt the flow of some questlines, but levelling has been overall improved so it doesn't take as long. You unlock each map at the corresponding level:

* Factory: Unlocked at start
* Customs: 5
* Woods: 10
* Shoreline: 15
* Interchange: 25
* Reserve: 35
* Lighthouse: 40
* Labs: 40

The readme will be updated with more info at a later time.
